# COVIDetector
An anonymous crowdsourced mobile solutions to track COVID-19 possible transmission. 

It’s a self-reporting and self-checking App letting you: know if you have been inadvertently in prolonged close proximity with any other diagnosed user; or if you are diagnosed then alert other users that they are in elevated risk of infection, without compromising your identity. 
- The proximity are estimated by Bluetooth signal strength (RSSN). 
- The user’s privacy and anonymity are protected by differential privacy mechanisms (bloom filter based)

A unique feature of this app is that even if you haven't been using this app, once installed it can still alert you if you have elevated risks.
