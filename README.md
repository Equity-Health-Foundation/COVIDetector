# COVIDetector
An anonymous crowdsourced mobile solutions to track COVID-19 possible transmission. 

It’s a self-reporting and self-checking App letting you: know if you have been inadvertently in prolonged close proximity with any other diagnosed user; or if you are diagnosed then alert other users that they are in elevated risk of infection, without compromising your identity. 
- The proximity are estimated by Bluetooth signal strength (RSSN). 
- The user’s privacy and anonymity are protected by differential privacy mechanisms (bloom filter based)

An unique feature of this app is that even if you have never installed this app before, once installed it can still show you immediately if you have elevated risks.
